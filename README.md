## 🎮 Folder 1: Games (Pygame)

In this folder, I explored **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and game logic by building **6 different games** using Python and the **Pygame** library.

### 🚀 What I Learned:

* **Game Loops:** Managing frame rates and game states.
* **Collision Detection:** Implementing logic for object interactions.
* **Asset Management:** Handling sprites, sounds, and user inputs.

## 🌐 Folder 2: Websites

This folder contains **3 distinct web projects**, ranging from educational tools to experimental designs.

### 1️⃣ Educational Website 📚

A website designed to teach a specific topic.

* **Focus:** Clean layout, information structure, and accessibility.

### 2️⃣ Web Game 🕹️

A browser-based game playable directly on the web.

* **Focus:** Interactive DOM manipulation and JavaScript logic.

### 3️⃣ The "Worst UX" Website (Joke Project) 🤪

A satirical project designed to have the **worst possible User Experience (UX)**.

* **Focus:** Purposefully breaking design rules (confusing navigation, bad colors, pop-ups) to understand *what not to do*.
