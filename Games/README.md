## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 1. Catch Him! (Turn-Based Strategy)
A grid-based strategy game where you play as the Police trying to catch Robbers before they escape. It features pathfinding logic and turn-based movement.

* **Mechanics:** Grid movement, obstacle destruction, AI pathfinding.
* **Controls:**
    * `Arrow Keys`: Move Police
    * `1-5`: Set step distance
    * `Space`: Use Bomb (Destroy walls)

### 2. Neon Shooter (Top-Down Shooter)
An arcade shooter featuring glowing vector graphics and particle effects. Survive as long as you can against waves of enemies.

* **Mechanics:** 360° shooting, particle systems, health bars, screen shake.
* **Controls:**
    * `WASD`: Move Player
    * `Mouse`: Aim
    * `Left Click`: Shoot

### 3. Avoid the Falling Blocks
A fast-paced survival game where the difficulty scales over time.

* **Mechanics:** Collision detection, increasing speed difficulty curve.
* **Controls:**
    * `Arrow Keys`: Move Player (Up, Down, Left, Right)
    * `R`: Restart game

## 🎨 Visual Experiments

### 4. Colorful Fading Circles
An interactive visualizer that spawns fading circles on click.
* **Concepts:** Alpha blending (transparency), list management, color randomization.
* **Controls:** `Left Click` to spawn visuals.

### 5. Turtle Generative Art
A script using Python's `turtle` library to generate complex geometric patterns.
* **Concepts:** loops, HSV to RGB color conversion, recursive drawing.

### 6. Draw Circles
A simple sandbox tool to test mouse inputs and basic drawing functions in Pygame.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Install Pygame:**
   You will need the `pygame` library for 5 of the 6 projects.
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

2. **Run the Game:**
    Run the specific python file you want to play.
    ```bash
    python "Neon Shooter.py"
    
    ```

### ⚠️ Important Note

**Don't forget to Right Click and "Trust" the file to open!**
If Windows blocks the file or you cannot run it, follow these steps:

1. **Right Click** the `.py` file.
2. Select **Properties**.
3. At the bottom, check the box that says **Unblock** or **Trust**.
4. Click **Apply** and **OK**.
